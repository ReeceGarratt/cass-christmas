## Overview

HealthCare Plus needed a patient portal that would allow users to manage appointments, view medical records, and communicate with healthcare providers. The goal was to reduce phone calls to the clinic and improve patient satisfaction.

## Problem Statement

Patients were frustrated with:
- Long phone wait times for scheduling appointments
- Difficulty accessing medical records
- Lack of visibility into test results
- Inconsistent communication with healthcare providers

## Research & Discovery

### Stakeholder Interviews
We interviewed doctors, nurses, and administrative staff to understand their workflows and pain points with the current system.

### Patient Research
Conducted 25 patient interviews and 5 contextual inquiries to understand how patients currently manage their healthcare.

### Competitive Analysis
Analyzed 10 existing patient portals to identify best practices and common pitfalls.

## Design Process

### User Personas
Created 4 detailed personas representing different patient demographics and tech-literacy levels.

### Information Architecture
Developed a clear structure prioritizing the most common tasks:
1. Schedule/manage appointments
2. View test results
3. Request prescription refills
4. Message providers

### Wireframes & Prototypes
Created low-fidelity wireframes for stakeholder feedback, then high-fidelity prototypes for user testing.

## Key Features

### Appointment Management
- Visual calendar view with available time slots
- One-click appointment rescheduling
- Automatic reminders via SMS and email
- Virtual visit integration

### Medical Records
- Timeline view of health history
- Downloadable lab results with explanations
- Medication list with refill tracking
- Vaccination records

### Communication
- Secure messaging with care team
- 24-hour response time guarantee
- Automatic routing to appropriate staff member
- File attachment support for images

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Screen reader optimized
- High contrast mode
- Adjustable font sizes

## Testing & Iteration

We conducted 3 rounds of usability testing with 30 participants:

**Round 1**: Identified issues with medical terminology and navigation
**Round 2**: Validated improvements to information hierarchy
**Round 3**: Final validation before launch

## Impact

Post-launch metrics showed strong adoption:

- **70%** of appointments now scheduled online
- **50%** reduction in phone calls to clinic
- **90%** patient satisfaction score
- **40%** increase in prescription refill requests (indicating better medication adherence)

## Lessons Learned

- Healthcare design requires special attention to accessibility and diverse user needs
- Plain language is crucial - avoid medical jargon
- Patient privacy and security must be prioritized in every design decision
- Regular testing with actual patients is essential

## Next Steps

Future enhancements include:
- Integration with wearable devices
- Family account management
- AI-powered symptom checker
- Multilingual support
