Curating a better Experience 

for the Import Collections Team.

Standard Bank provides a service known as Import Collections in which they act as an 
intermediary between their Client (a business importing goods) and a foreign bank 
representing the exporter. This service reduces the risk for the importer while earning the 
bank a transaction fee.

Up until now, initiating this service has been a manual process, requiring Standard Bank 
staff to manually capture, cross check and audit data. 

I was tasked with transforming this interaction into an easier and faster journey on 
Standard Bank’s B2B platform, Trade Online.

User Journeys

With my BA I performed an Observational study with the staff to gain a better idea of their AS-IS process. This 
allowed us to better identify where we could optimise and gave our users the ability to voice any pains in the 
moment.

Taking it Step by Step.

The Standard Bank Import Collections Staff were spending many hours per project referencing screenshots and printed physical 
documents to capture data in their system.

The Business Goals & Needs

Business felt that the staff were spending more time on data capturing than providing excellent service to their clients.To better 
understands businesses concerns we held a one day workshop to identify their needs

 Smooth and Accurate data capturing
 Reduce swivel chairing
 Tracking of where the client is in their process for better reporting;

What was Actually Happening?.

Identify Business Needs

Our Users.

The Client

The Standard Bank Client who is 
importing goods.

Due to Bank Regulations we were not 
able to talk to The Client user. We spoke 
to The Trade Officer and The Checker and 
plan on getting user feedback from The 
Client once there is a live version of the 
platform.

The Checker

Employee responsible for double 
checking the data the Trade Officer 
uploaded

Key Pain Points

 Keeping track of projects awaiting 
checking

 Unnecessary mistakes.

The Trade Officer

Employee responsible for receiving and 
capturing data they receive from the 
Client.

Key Pain Points

 The use of 5 different platforms
 The amount of time spent uploading 
data
 Keeping track of data across multiple 
platforms and emails
 No quick reference to where in the 
process the client is.

User Research

The new user journey.
Our Goal was to keep our users in one platform for as much of the journey as possible. 

<image src="/images/import-collections-3.png" alt="Import Collections new journey diagram" />

For the Trade Officer we worked to reduce swivel chairing by integrating the required programs 
where possible.

For the Checker we focused on improving access to the projects, making changes requests faster 
and trackable.

For the Client our goal was to make it accessible and approving the captured data on the Trade 
Online platform.

User Journeys

Future State - Contextual Change requests

As a future improvement we want to connect the change request directly to the field it relates to. Allowing the Checker to make notes in 
context instead of them having to pause their flow to scroll down and add comments to a list in the text box.

This will also assist the Trade Officer when they are making updates.

Checker users are able to add comments to the project file that would trigger an email and 
platform notification for the Trade Officer. These comments would be trackable in the project 
history.

Reviewing & Requesting Changes.

To help expedite the data capturing process we broke down the data required into smaller chunks 
and organised them according to how they can appear on the documentation. This approach not 
only reduces the amount of information the user see’s at once, its also helps them re-start incase 
they are disturbed.

Future State - Automagical Data

The future state we were developing was to allow the agent to upload the scanned documentation and 
use a document scanning API to automatically fill in the data as it saw it on the document.

Wireframing & UI Design

Easier Data Capture.
