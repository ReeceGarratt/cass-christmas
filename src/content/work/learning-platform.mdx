Joe Public United is a marketing company whose defining business goal is to drive
continuous learning and professional growth for it’s employees.

Historically Joe Public United employees have been required to use an excel sheet to
track their career goals and KGI (Key Growth Indicators). The company found that
60% of their employees weren’t achieving their set goals or KGI’s.

As an employee at the time I was painfully aware of what the experience of the
dreaded excel sheet was, so when I was approached by the HR team to design a
platform for this I jumped at the chance.

This project covered multiple aspects of a goal tracking interface including a
dashboard, goal set up, reviewing goals with managers, setting up KPI’s etc. For this
case study I will be focusing on the setting up of new goals on the platform.

  Identify Business Needs
</SectionHeading>

## Why isn't the excel sheet working for business?.

Before taking this question to the users I asked the head of HR, the Chief Growth Officer and a line manager why they felt the current system wasn’t working and I received the following answers0
* Staff didn’t understand how to fill out the excel sheet and HR was spending large amounts of time teaching staff to use the system every year
* Set out goals were not being met by 60% of the company.

**The Business Goals & Needs**

Business wanted a platform that would improve employee engagement with their goals %
* Managers to track goal progress for each user.
* KGI’s could be set and assigned.
* Data could be automatically collected on goal success rates and employee success
* Goals could be set up before hand and only reviewed with management

For the sake of this case study I am only focusing on the employee goal setting portion of this project.

  User Research
</SectionHeading>

## Understanding the User

I spent 3 days interviewing 5 users across different departments and learnt the following:

**How my user set goals in their daily lives:**

* They take a look at something in their careers or lives that they find is hindering their improvement.
* Think of ways to solve the problem.
* Breakdown their solutions in actionable steps.


**What they thought of the existing Joe Grow system**
* Goals are too “big picture" Users found that they were setting goals that felt too big to start making them feel
overwhelmed.
* The excel sheet has been confusing, complicated and hard to use. Causing them to always need help when it was time
to set their goals.
* Use of uncommon terms or tracking methods that aren t intuitive.
* The design of the excel sheet kept changing making it even more confusing
* The experience relayed heavily on the manager you had.
* 30% of my users could explain how to use a Joe Grow Excel Sheet.

#### "I always feel stupid when I do my Joe Grow"
<br/>
The primary positive feedback I received was around the initiative itself and how it encouraged users to reflect on their careers
and communicate their needs to their managers.

<Card variant={"secondary"}>
**Lesson Learnt**

    During these interviews I found that users were very hesitant to share anything negative they had to say about the existing system. In one
    case a participant actually expressed fear of being reprimanded by management.

    This highlighted the importance of making a safe space for users where feedback is anonymous and my goals and intentions are clear.

  Personas
</SectionHeading>

Using the data collected during my interviews I created 3 personas to keep our user types in
mind during the design and review process.

<SectionGrid>
  <Card 
    heading={"The Untrained Goal-Setter"}
    icon={`${base}person-svgrepo-com.svg`}>

    Employees unfamiliar with creating goals within the growth ecosystem.
  </Card>
  <Card 
    heading={"The Experienced Goal-Setter"}
    icon={`${base}person-svgrepo-com.svg`}>
    
    Employees that are familiar with setting
    goals in their personal lives and/or in
    the growth ecosystem.
  </Card>
  <Card 
    heading={"The Non-Goal-Setter"}
    icon={`${base}person-svgrepo-com.svg`}>

    Employees that aren't familiar with setting goals in their personal or in the growth ecosystem.

## How do users set a good goals?

I researched the psychology behind successful goal setting, looking into different methodologies and ways to
motivate meeting goals.

I learnt alot about the ABCs of goals, types of goals, the E-E-E Model of goal setting, Locke’s theory but found that
S.M.A.R.T goals covered the majority of what motivates somebody to reach a goal. Looking at my data and
stakeholder requirements I followed the S.M.A.R.T goal framework.

  User Journeys
</SectionHeading>

## Guiding users through building goals.

Looking at how my users explained how they approach personal goals, their concerns with the existing platform
and S.M.A.R.T goals I started to build an journey that would reflect the needs of my users.

        **Phase 1: Educational Page**

        Here we focused on educating the employee on the benefits and purpose of a Joe Grow, 
        with the aim of improving existing attitudes/assumptions towards the product.
    </Card>
    <Card>
        **Phase 2: Identifying their current position and desired future position**

        Identifying their current position and desired future position. 
        Answering where they currently were in their career and where they would like to be by the next quarter.

        eg: Currently a Junior but wants to be a Midweight
    </Card>
    <Card>
        **Phase 3: What stands in their way (obstacles)**

        Obstacles that could prevent them from getting to where they want to be. Or things they would need to achieve their goals
    </Card>
    <Card>
        **Phase 4: Goals to move past obstacles**

        Getting the user to breakdown their obstacle into smaller goals that they can achieve.
    </Card>
    <Card>
        **Phase 5: Review and edit goals with their manager**

        The user gets a second opinion on their goals and if they will help them progress.
    </Card>
    <Card>
        **Phase 6: Key Growth Indicators**

        KPIs are assigned to each employee by their manager, who will then sit with them to discuss how they can meet these.

        Example:

        KPI: *Streamlining the briefing process*

        Goal: *Review & Update current briefing template*

    ### So what did users think of this?

    When my low fidelity wireframes were presented to some of our users we found that they didn t fully understand what we were saying, 
    literally. The majority of our users weren't able to fill out the required form fields because they didn t understand what the labels meant.


    During my conversations with the users I was able to find phrases
    that clearly explained what was being asked. This change also had
    the positive side effect of making the platform feel more
    conversational and approachable.

## The Outcome

At the end of the first iteration of this project the platform was launched and socialised with its users with a
focus on little to no training. The product has been a huge success and is reported to have improved the
general attitude towards these goal setting exercises.
