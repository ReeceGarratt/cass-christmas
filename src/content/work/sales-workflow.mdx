MiX Telematics provides connected and secure fleet telematics data and mobile 
asset management solutions for customers. Delivering hardware and software 
tailored to their customers needs and fleets.


A huge part of MiX Telematics’ growth strategy is directly related to their ability to 
win new clients while still providing for the needs of their long-term clients. This has 
been hindered by an out of date Salesforce system that impacts their ability to 
provide new or updated quotes in a timely manner - ultimately causing a loss in 
business. In addition to losing business MiX Telematics has also found that they are 
losing high-quality staff due to the frustrating system and workflow.

    Identify Business Needs
</SectionHeading>

## A conversation with Business Stakeholders.

To better understand MiX Telematics’ goals I had a discovery session with the head of platform support and the CTO. They
supplied me with the following business needs:

* A faster quoting system
* Self-sufficient users
* A lower barrier to entry for new staff
* More automation where possible

    AS-IS Journey
</SectionHeading>

## Understanding the As Is.

To better understand how the platform was supposed to be used my team and I had a workshop with a leader that
manages training of new staff. With her help we developed an in-depth AS IS map with explanations of related
responsibilities, platforms and processes .

<TwoColumn> 
    <div>
        From these interviews we found that the majority of the users:

        * had fields they didnt understand.
        * have to take steps they feel are redundant.
        * important steps are taken at the wrong times.
        * find the platform very hard to learn and had to make multiple notes (that some still refer to).
        * they are losing clients because of the turn around time.

## User Interviews & Observation

To best understand what the pain points were and how to solve them, we ran interview and
observation sessions with the sales staff. From these sessions, we identified 6 key pain
points.

<TwoColumn> 
    <div>
    1. Inaccessible, Inconsistent language is being used.

    2. There are multiple instances of swivel-chairing.

    3. Users weren’t being notified of approvals or new system requirements regarding quote-production.

    4. Onboarding and upskilling is a high-effort and time-consuming task.

    5. No automation is used to speed up tasks.

    6. The system doesn’t match their real-world sales journey.
    </div>
     ### "there are things that I'm gonna be capturing, but I wont know if you ask me ‘why are you capturing this?’ I will not tell you or just tell you this is what I was told to choose"
</TwoColumn>

### "you can see how long this now is taking me to just get all that information and complete. Only to be told a week later that sorry dude, we cant do business with you."

During our interviews it was brought to our attention multiple times that if a new sales quote
is found to be incorrect at any step except the original data capture form’ the sale would be
considered a ‘Lost’ lead This is recorded on the sales persons monthly sales reports.

## Team Workshop.

<TwoColumn>
    <div>
    The design team assessed all of the data, outlined consistent recommendations and ideated ways to
    implement them. Once we were happy with the solutions we had a session with a Salesforce specialist
    to ensure our solutions would be executable

    User Journey
</SectionHeading>

## An Improved User Journey

Using the information gathered we brainstormed ways to improve the AS IS journey, with the sole goal of
making the process match our users real life sales journey and create an agile approach to their workflow,
allowing for multiple work streams to happen at once per department. The team managed to reduce the
journey from 22 to 14 steps in total.
