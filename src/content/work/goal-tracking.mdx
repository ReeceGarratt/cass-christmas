Goal Summary

Re-imagining Joe Public United's Goal 
Setting & Tracking Platform.

Joe Public United is a marketing company whose defining business goal is to drive 
continuous learning and professional growth for it’s employees.

Historically Joe Public United employees have been required to use an excel sheet to 
track their career goals and KGI (Key Growth Indicators). The company found that 
60% of their employees weren’t achieving their set goals or KGI’s.

As an employee at the time I was painfully aware of what the experience of the 
dreaded excel sheet was, so when I was approached by the HR team to design a 
platform for this I jumped at the chance.

This project covered multiple aspects of a goal tracking interface including a 
dashboard, goal set up, reviewing goals with managers, setting up KPI’s etc. For this 
case study I will be focusing on the setting up of new goals on the platform.

Identify Business Needs

Why isn’t the excel sheet working for business?
Before taking this question to the users I asked the head of HR, the Chief Growth Officer and a line manager why they felt the 
current system wasn’t working and I received the following answers

 Staff didn’t understand how to fill out the excel sheet and HR was spending large amounts of time teaching staff to use the 
system every year

 Set out goals were not being met by 60% of the company.

The Business Goals & Needs

Business wanted a platform that would improve employee engagement with their goals  

 Managers to track goal progress for each user
 KGI’s could be set and assigned
 Data could be automatically collected on goal success rates and employee succes
 Goals could be set up before hand and only reviewed with management

For the sake of this case study I am only focusing on the employee goal setting portion of this project.

User Research

Understanding the User.
I spent 3 days interviewing 5 users across different departments and learnt the following:

How my user set goals in their daily lives

 They take a look at something in their careers or lives that they find is hindering their improvement
 Think of ways to solve the problem
 Breakdown their solutions in actionable steps.

What they thought of the existing Joe Grow syste

 Goals are too “big picture” - Users found that they were setting goals that felt too big to start making them feel 
overwhelmed

 The excel sheet has been confusing, complicated and hard to use. Causing them to always need help when it was time 
to set their goals

 Use of uncommon terms or tracking methods that aren’t intuitive
 The design of the excel sheet kept changing making it even more confusin
 The experience relayed heavily on the manager you had
 30% of my users could explain how to use a Joe Grow Excel Sheet.

I always feel stupid when I do my Joe Grow

The primary positive feedback I received was around the initiative itself and how it encouraged users to reflect on their careers 
and communicate their needs to their managers.

Lesson Learnt

During these interviews I found that users were very hesitant to share anything negative they had to say about the existing system. In one 
case a participant actually expressed fear of being reprimanded by management.

This highlighted the importance of making a safe space for users where feedback is anonymous and my goals and intentions are clear.

User Personas.
Using the data collected during my interviews I created 3 personas to keep our user types in 
mind during the design and review process.

The non-goal Setter

Employees that aren’t familiar with 
setting goals in their personal or in 
the growth ecosystem.

The Experienced Goal Setter

Employees that are familiar with setting 
goals in their personal lives and/or in 
the growth ecosystem.

The Untrained Goal Setter

Employees unfamiliar with creating 
goals within the 'Growth' ecosystem.

Persona’s

I researched the psychology behind successful goal setting, looking into different methodologies and ways to 
motivate meeting goals.

I learnt alot about the ABC’s of goals, types of goals, the E-E-E Model of goal setting, Locke’s theory but found that 
S.M.A.R.T goals covered the majority of what motivates somebody to reach a goal. Looking at my data and 
stakeholder requirements I followed the S.M.A.R.T goal framework.

How do users set a good goals?

Desktop Research

Phase 1: Educational Page

Here we focused on educating the 
employee on the benefits and purpose of 
a Joe Grow, with the aim of improving 
existing attitudes/assumptions towards 
the product.

Phase 2: Identifying their current position and desired future position

 Identifying their current position and 
desired future position. Answering where 
they currently were in their career and 
where they would like to be by the next 
quarter.

eg: Currently a Junior but wants to be a 
Midweight

Phase 3:  What stands in their way (obstacles)

Obstacles that could prevent them 
from getting to where they want to 
be. Or things they would need to 
achieve their goals.

Phase 4:  Goals to move past obstacles

Getting the user to breakdown their 
obstacle into smaller goals that they 
can achieve.

Phase 5:   Review and edit goals with their manager

The user gets a second opinion on 
their goals and if they will help them 
progress.

Phase 6:   Key Growth Indicators

KPIs are assigned to each employee 
by their manager, who will then sit 
with them to discuss how they can 
meet these.

Example:

KPI: Streamlining the briefing process

Goal: Review & Update current 
briefing template

Looking at how my users explained how they approach personal goals, their concerns with the existing platform 
and S.M.A.R.T goals I started to build an journey that would reflect the needs of my users.

Guiding users through building goals.

User Journeys

When my low fidelity wireframes were presented to some of our 
users we found that they didn’t fully understand what we were 
saying, literally. The majority of our users weren’t able to fill out the 
required form fields because they didn’t understand what the labels 
meant.

During my conversations with the users I was able to find phrases 
that clearly explained what was being asked. This change also had 
the positive side effect of making the platform feel more 
conversational and approachable.

So what did users think of this?

Wireframing & UI Design

At the end of the first iteration of this project the platform was launched and socialised with its users with a 
focus on little to no training. The product has been a huge success and is reported to have improved the 
general attitude towards these goal setting exercises.

The Outcome.
