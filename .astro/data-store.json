FinTech Solutions wanted to create an intuitive dashboard that makes financial data accessible to non-financial experts.\n\n## Challenge\n\nDesign a financial dashboard that:\n- Makes complex financial data understandable\n- Provides actionable insights\n- Works for diverse business types\n- Requires minimal financial expertise\n\n## Research Phase\n\n### User Interviews\nInterviewed 30 small business owners across various industries to understand their financial management practices.\n\n### Pain Points Identified\n- Overwhelming amount of data in traditional tools\n- Unclear how to interpret financial reports\n- Time-consuming to track cash flow\n- Difficulty forecasting future performance\n\n### User Needs\n- Quick overview of business health\n- Clear alerts for issues requiring attention\n- Easy comparison of time periods\n- Simple export for accountant sharing\n\n## Design Solution\n\n### Dashboard Overview\nCreated a scannable dashboard with three priority levels:\n1. **Critical metrics** at the top (cash position, overdue invoices)\n2. **Key trends** in the middle (revenue, expenses, profit)\n3. **Detailed reports** accessible via tabs\n\n### Data Visualization\n- Color-coded indicators for quick status assessment\n- Trend lines showing direction of change\n- Comparative views (month-over-month, year-over-year)\n- Interactive charts with hover details\n\n### Smart Insights\nImplemented automated insights that:\n- Highlight unusual patterns\n- Suggest actions for improvement\n- Predict cash flow issues\n- Identify cost-saving opportunities\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Cash Flow Tracking\nReal-time view of money in and out with projections for next 30/60/90 days.\n\n### Invoice Management\nTrack outstanding invoices with automated reminders and payment links.\n\n### Expense Categorization\nAutomatic categorization with the ability to create custom categories and tags.\n\n### Financial Reports\nOne-click generation of standard reports (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement).\n\n### Goal Setting\nSet financial goals and track progress with visual indicators.\n\n## Usability Testing\n\nConducted 4 rounds of testing with 20 participants:\n\n### Round 1: Concept Validation\nTested information architecture and primary workflows.\n\n### Round 2: Visual Design\nValidated data visualization choices and color schemes.\n\n### Round 3: Detailed Features\nTested individual features like invoice management and reporting.\n\n### Round 4: End-to-End\nFull workflow testing from onboarding to daily use.\n\n## Results\n\nThe dashboard launched successfully with strong user adoption:\n\n- **85%** of users log in at least weekly\n- **4.7** star rating on review sites\n- **40%** reduction in time spent on financial management\n- **65%** of users report better understanding of their finances\n\n### User Feedback\n\n> \"Finally, a financial tool that doesn't require an accounting degree. I can see exactly how my business is doing at a glance.\"\n\n> \"The insights feature has helped me catch issues before they became serious problems.\"\n\n## Design System\n\nCreated a comprehensive design system including:\n- Component library\n- Data visualization guidelines\n- Interaction patterns\n- Accessibility standards\n\nThis enabled the development team to move faster and maintain consistency across the platform.\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\nWorked closely with engineers to ensure:\n- Fast data loading and rendering\n- Responsive design for mobile use\n- Secure data handling\n- Real-time updates\n\n## Reflection\n\nThis project taught me the importance of:\n- Progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming users\n- Context-sensitive help for complex features\n- Balancing detail with simplicity\n- Iterating based on real usage data\n\nThe most successful aspect was the smart insights feature, which users consistently mentioned as the most valuable part of the dashboard.","src/content/work/financial-dashboard.mdx","e40e43dd6abcded1","financial-dashboard.mdx","ecommerce-redesign",{"id":50,"data":52,"body":64,"filePath":65,"digest":66,"legacyId":67,"deferredRender":24},{"title":53,"description":54,"client":55,"role":56,"year":18,"tags":57,"featured":24,"coverImage":62,"order":63},"E-Commerce Mobile App Redesign","Redesigning the shopping experience for a leading fashion retailer","Fashion Forward","Lead UX Designer",[58,59,60,61],"Mobile","E-Commerce","User Research","Prototyping","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512941937669-90a1b58e7e9c?w=800&h=500&fit=crop",1,"## Overview\n\nFashion Forward approached us to redesign their mobile shopping experience. The existing app had a high bounce rate and low conversion rates, especially among younger users aged 18-35.\n\n## Challenge\n\nThe main challenges were:\n- Complex navigation making it hard to find products\n- Slow checkout process with too many steps\n- Lack of personalization and social features\n- Poor performance on lower-end devices\n\n## Research\n\nWe conducted extensive user research including:\n\n**User Interviews**: 20 interviews with current and potential users to understand their shopping habits and pain points.\n\n**Usability Testing**: Tested the existing app with 15 users to identify specific friction points.\n\n**Analytics Review**: Analyzed 6 months of app usage data to understand user behavior patterns.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n- Users abandoned cart most often at the payment step\n- 70% of users wanted to see how items looked on real people\n- Navigation was the #1 complaint in user feedback\n- Users wanted easier access to wishlist and saved items\n\n## Solution\n\nBased on our research, we implemented several key improvements:\n\n### Streamlined Navigation\nRedesigned the information architecture with a simplified category structure and improved search functionality with filters.\n\n### Enhanced Product Discovery\nAdded personalized recommendations, user-generated content, and AR try-on feature for accessories.\n\n### Simplified Checkout\nReduced checkout from 5 steps to 3, added guest checkout option, and integrated popular payment methods including Apple Pay and Google Pay.\n\n### Social Features\nIntegrated user reviews with photos, created a style inspiration feed, and added wish list sharing capabilities.\n\n## Results\n\nThe redesign led to significant improvements:\n\n- **45%** increase in conversion rate\n- **60%** reduction in cart abandonment\n- **4.8** star rating in app stores (up from 3.2)\n- **35%** increase in average session duration\n\n## Takeaways\n\nThis project reinforced the importance of user research and iterative design. The most impactful changes came from addressing specific user pain points rather than adding new features.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Simple navigation is crucial for mobile e-commerce\n- Social proof significantly influences purchase decisions\n- Performance optimization is as important as visual design\n- Continuous testing and iteration leads to better outcomes","src/content/work/ecommerce-redesign.mdx","e436a95e38127863","ecommerce-redesign.mdx","learning-platform",{"id":68,"data":70,"body":82,"filePath":83,"digest":84,"legacyId":85,"deferredRender":24},{"title":71,"description":72,"client":73,"role":17,"year":38,"tags":74,"featured":79,"coverImage":80,"order":81},"Learning Platform Redesign","Improving the online learning experience for students and educators","EduTech Academy",[75,76,77,78],"Education","Learning","Gamification","Mobile First",false,"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501504905252-473c47e087f8?w=800&h=500&fit=crop",4,"## Project Overview\n\nEduTech Academy's learning platform needed a refresh to improve student engagement and course completion rates.
